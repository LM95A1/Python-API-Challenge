# Python API Challenge
*Python API Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 6*

This repository contains the necessary script in a Jupyter Notebook as requested for the Python API Challenge. The notebook also includes the short analysis of the data.

## Dependencies
---
These Jupyter Notebooks was handcrafted in Visual Studio Code and tested in Python 3.11.3 by opening the terminal within the directory containing the notebook and running the following commands:
    
 
    jupyter notebook 'WeatherPy Workspace.ipynb'
    jupyter notebook 'VacationPy Workspace.ipynb'
  
 All dependencies are included in each notebook.

## Credits
---
All the documentation for both the OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify API were used to complete this assignment. The documentation can be found at the following links:

[OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)

[Geoapify API Documentation](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs)

Along with the activities and examples provided in the module, Professor Irfan's guidance and the study group with Tatiana, Dustin, Thomas and Miggy was crucial to the completion of this assignment.

Stack Overflow was utilized for this since I kept bashing my head against the wall with certain minor errors.

Coding Soundtrack for this week was Beartooth's album, [Disease](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-K1HfAYErhRPt99e79MiWj_1AGfMtrs-).
